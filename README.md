USBListener
===========

This program is a GUI application that polls a USB radio transceiver for data from a Raspberry Pi. It then inputs that data using asynchronous programming to a list box and a chart.
There was also a work in progress for the program to save the data as an xml document which changed to saving the data to a SQL server.
Finally the project was scrapped in favour of using the MVC framework so that a user would not have to install anything on a home computer and would be able to log in from any device to view their data.
